# AppointmentManager
An unfinished college assignment meant to work as an appointment manager and to demonstrate my ability to work with SQL through Java applications. The original assignment was completed, but has since been lost. If I manage to find it, this listing will be updated to reflect the finished product.

Because this software is meant to connect to an SQL database, it will not properly function on its own. I have lost access to the original database provided by my school for use with this assignment. I have attemted to set up my own server, and I have modified the application to connect to it, but I can not verify how well this works. Without access to a server, the most that can be done with this program is an observation of the application's layout thorugh its FXML files, and an inspection of the code, to see if it actually demonstrates an understanding of how to develop an SQL Java application.

This application was created with Java using the Apache Netbeans IDE, as well as the SceneBuilder application, for the design of the forms. To attempt to run the application on Windows, you will need to go into the dist folder and run the Software2Assignment.bat file. Doing so will run the necessary console commands to connect the Software2Assignment.jar file with the javafx library, both also contained in the same dist folder. The jar file will then begin executing, and you will be able to interact with the application through its GUI.

If you wish to see the code itself, the project can be opened in the Apache Netbeans IDE to view it directly. The various FXML files can also be opened up in SceneBuilder, to get a look at them as well.
